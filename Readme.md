Blackguard game.

Blackguard is a Rogue-like game with a Doom-like first-person shooter interface.

Rogue is a game that holds close to Dungeons & Dragons.

In addition to the 3D interface, one of the goals was to have sprites for the monsters and objects to make them more recognizable.
Currently they are represented by characters, as in the original game. 
Unfortunately the artwork necessary for this was not done, making it a nice enhancement opportunity.
